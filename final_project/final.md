# Final Project Documentation Template (WIP)

All the documentation of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/guillemontecinos/itp_fall_2018_open_source_studio/blob/master/final_project/documentation.md).

## Project Title

**Tracking of p5.js Spanish website translation and development of a translation guide (for any language)**

*This project consist in a collaboration with the internationalization (i18n) of the p5.js website. It consisted in the translation of content to Spanish and the develop of a documentation document that will gather all the information needed for future collaborations on website translation, focused on first-time contributors and non-English speakers.*

## Define the problem you addressed and greater landscape

This project attempted to address the problem of creating and maintaining translations to new languages other than English of the p5.js website. As an open-source and community-led project p5.js doesn't count with the resources to maintain and incorporate multiple languages automatically or by contributors.

This project goals were: 1) to review existing Spanish translations of the website and translate pages that haven been translated yet, and 2) develop a documentation document that could facilitate new contributions. Before this project the only resource and guidelines to learn how to contribute in new or existing translations was the repository's [README](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website) file which -even it contains essential information- is brief and leaves too many points without explanation.

This idea came after a collaboration I did last year with Aar√≥n Montoya-Moraga when he translated both the website and the book to Spanish.

## Implementation
1. _What themes, readings, and discussion from [the first half of this course](https://github.com/Open-Source-Studio-at-ITP/Syllabus) were most relevant to your work on this project? Version Control, Community / Code of Conduct, Unit Testing, Documentation and Accessibility, Software Licensing, Project Funding_

Due to this collaboration was a pure open-source contribution -because discussions were held with other community members- the entire first part of the course was very useful. In one hand soft skills in open-source that were learned led me to kindly deal with discussions with other contributors. On the other hand, technical skills as the use of git and GitHub made this process very easy. Examples of this were the assignments in which we had to fork a repository, commit changes from a local branch and then submit a Pull Request. That was incredibly useful for this project.
2. _Describe the technical details about your implementation and development process._


3. _What challenges, stumbling blocks, difficulties did you encounter along the way._
4. _How did your final development line up with your proposal timeline._
5. _What was your biggest success? What was your biggest failure?_
