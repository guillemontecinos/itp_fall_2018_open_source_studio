This is a collaboration with p5.js

_Write an abstract -- describe your idea in a short paragraph, 250 words maximum._

## Define the problem.

The internationalization of p5.js through it's website has been a great decision in terms of spreading p5.js' ideals and making programming easier to non-English speaking users. This process has meant maintenance efforts in order to designing a flexible structure for the website and keeping track of changes made in the English, and particularly in Spanish has experienced delays in the translation due to the effort it requires. Currently there are two official translation: Spanish and Chinese.

p5.js website has [two main structures](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website#internationalization-i18n-and-structure): the Reference and all other pages that are not the Reference. The non-Reference pages are developed in HTML files that define the structure and call handlers for each written content. These handlers display the text contents in the language the page is to be rendered which are stored in .yml files. On the other hand, the Reference pages are entirely written in English and swapped out using JS.

All the information for website translation can be found in the [README](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website) file of the website repo, but it seems to be not clear at all, so it can be wrapped in a separated file with examples and a more detailed explanation as it's said in the [issue #23](https://github.com/Open-Source-Studio-at-ITP/Final-Projects/issues/23) of the Final Projects repo.

The final audience of this project are, on one hand, all the non-English speaking users of p5.js -this includes coders, educators and students-, and on the other hand, all users and collaborators that are interested in work in new translations of the website.
