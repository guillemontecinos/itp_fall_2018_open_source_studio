# Final Project Proposal Template

## Project Title

p5.js website translation collaboration

This is a collaboration with p5.js

_Write an abstract -- describe your idea in a short paragraph, 250 words maximum._

## Define the problem.

The [internationalization](https://p5js.org/es/) of p5.js through it's website has been a great decision in terms of spreading p5.js' ideals and making programming easier to non-English speaking users. This process has meant a great effort in order to designing a flexible website structure and keeping track of the changes made in the English. Currently there are two official translation: Spanish and Chinese. Particularly the Spanish version has experienced delays in the translation due to the last reference issues incorporated.

In terms of structure, p5.js website has [two](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website#internationalization-i18n-and-structure) ways of construction. The Reference pages are entirely written in English and swapped out using JavaScript. On the other hand, the non-reference pages are developed in HTML using handlers which display the text contents in the language the page is to be rendered, which are stored in .yml files.

All the information for website translation can be found in the [README](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website) file of the website repo, but it seems to be not clear at all, so it can be wrapped in a separated file with examples and a more detailed explanation as it's said in the [issue #23](https://github.com/Open-Source-Studio-at-ITP/Final-Projects/issues/23) of the Final Projects repo.

The final audience of this project are, on one hand, all the non-English speaking users of p5.js -this includes coders, educators and students-, and on the other hand, all users and collaborators that are interested in work in new translations of the website.

## Address Greater Landscape

p5.js is an open source community-driven project created by Lauren McCarthy and the [Processing Foundation](https://processingfoundation.org) as a web re-interpretation of Processing. Technically, p5.js is a set of functions for JavaScript that allows the user to create visual and sound interactive applications on the browser, with a easy-to-use syntax.

As a part of the Processing Foundation, p5.js was intended as a vehicle for spreading coding literacy between the non-programmer community, specially the under-represented and discriminated ones. Furthermore, p5.js is a [Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS)](https://medium.com/processing-foundation/processing-and-floss-d35aa4607f4c) and therefore an alternative to corporate and exclusive softwares.

<!-- _Please address how the open source project you are creating or contributing to fits into a greater field or tech landscape. Who has done similar work before? How are you building off this, and how? What sets your project apart from your colleagues?_ -->

## Deliverables

* Review and fix Spanish Website translation
* Review and fix Spanish Reference translations
* Review and fix Spanish Examples translations
* Write a TRANSLATION.md document with all guidelines and examples for future website translations

## Documentation

I will document this project in my own [OSS repo](https://github.com/guillemontecinos/itp_fall_2018_open_source_studio) through posts published in the Final Project folder. Additionally, the project progress will be tracked on issues I'll post in the p5.js repo and the final pull requests I'll commit when the project is finished. I'll make an effort to cross-reference post and issues/PRs.

<!-- _Describe your plan for documentation. Will you keep a blog? Make videos? Some project management tool? Track everything on GitHub as issues?_ -->

## Accessibility

_What challenges are there related to your project in terms of Web Content Accessibility Requirements: [see the Accessibility assignment as a reference](https://github.com/Open-Source-Studio-at-ITP/Syllabus/blob/source/accessibility-assignment.md#instructions)._

## Mentoring

For this project a mentor guide will be needed mostly for organizing and structuring the output guide/wrapping file. I propose the following highly experienced people for this:

* Lauren McCarthy
* Aarón Montoya-Moraga
* Kenneth Lim

<!-- _List some possible mentors for this project. Describe what kinds of help you need (technical, conceptual, outreach, etc.)_ -->

## More about you

I'm interested in the weird space where technology and art intersects and can describe myself as a technologist and a musician.

I am also an educator and co-founder of a media arts school in Chile called [Coded Escuela](http://codedescuela.cl), where a group of artists and tech people teach creative code and FLOSS tools to creative people. With Coded we have contributed with the internationalization of Processing in Spanish by teaching creative coding with p5.js and with the translation of the website and book which was leaded by [Aarón Montoya-Moraga](http://montoyamoraga.io/) and supported by us.

This project is framed within my previous work in the field of FLOSS education and with the Processing Foundation (on 2017 I [spoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix5RTKRJW0A&index=6&list=PLMVpERuYgvujgdaBluS0_LLLn8T83laaa) in the Processing Community Day @ MIT Media Lab).

If you have an online portfolio, github account, or other relevant documentation of your work, please include links. If the project is a collaboration, a section should be included for each collaborator._ -->
