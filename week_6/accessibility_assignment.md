*by Guillermo Montecinos. October 15th, 2018*

A web accessibility audit was committed as an assignment for the Open Source Studio Class, ITP Fall 2018. For this, the website of the [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org) project was chosen.

The methodology applied for this task was a complementary use of the [WAVE - Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) and the Mac screen reader *VoieceOver*.
