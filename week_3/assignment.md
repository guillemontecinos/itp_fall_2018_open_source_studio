# Assignment week 3

Answering myself regarding last week assignment, open source's community can't lightly be seen as a community of love moved by common wellness goals. This is a community made of persons whom in some cases care about interpersonal relationships by having kind manners, but in other don't. And as in off-line relationships people can be rude, bigot and disrespectful with diversity.
As is stated in some of the reading, rudeness is a broadly spread problem within Computer Science (CS) culture. I think the reason for that is that the field of engineering is governed by a macho culture in which a supremacy of men over women slightly perpetuated in the way CS tech is taught in the academia, were most teachers are male. I say this from my experience as engineering student 10 years ago, maybe things have changed since then and also maybe things are different in Chile and the US. But as I can learn from my peers at this class, nothing has changed and women -specially in tech- are not treated as equals.
In this perspective I really appreciate the ethical concern stated by Saber Khan and discussed in the community of #CSforAll, because since most coders -and technicians- are trained at formal education institutions, those are the places where bad practices are reproduced and where the biggest efforts must be focused on to eradicate them.
