# Final Project Ideas - Open Source Studio
*by Guillermo Montecinos, NYU ITP Fall 2018*

## Processing Foundation - GSoC
I'm a devote of p5.js and the Processing Foundation and have collaborated for a year and a half developing academic material to p5.js beginners in Spanish. I've also applied twice to the Fellowship call without success. I'm opened to collaborate in any need of the project p5.js or the Foundation itself.

## ml5.js

### Pre-trained models
Some pre-trained models for style transfer -as *Matilde PÃ©rez* and *Matta*- are not as accurate as expected. I'd like to improve them by checking the dataset built for training the model and correcting if needed. I'd like to train other models if there are any on demand.

### Learning material
I've realized that ml5.js learning material is pretty well documented. Apart from that there are tutorials in The Coding Train.
Despite, there are many things to do in order to make ML more accessible. I'd like to develop an intro tutorial more detailed, maybe as a proto-tiny-guide, inspired in the intro to p5.js book. If not, there is material still in a development stage, as the [pix2pix tutorial](https://ml5js.org/docs/pix2pix-example) that could be addressed.

### Code
I don't know if coding improves are needed in the project -probably there are- but I'd like to collaborate in them.

## Wekinator
Wekinator as a ML tool for creative purposes -mainly for live performances- is very useful and challenging. The problem of Wekinator is its the [documentation](http://www.wekinator.org/detailed-instructions/) is not friendly. I guess it's due project is that was created and has been maintained for only one person -despite it's stated as an open-source project.

I'd like to collaborate by creating a more detailed documentation or a set of tutorials that could help beginners to start using Wekinator.

## Runway ML
As ml5.js, [Runway's examples](https://github.com/runwayml) are very well documented for coders, but I think they are little hidden for non coders. I'd like to collaborate with this project by developing learning material or a detailed tutorial -written or video- more accessible for users that don't use to code.
